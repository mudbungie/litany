# leak scan (from yog bl-fd5a/bl-167d) — the disclosure half of the gate.
# The rest of the gate asks whether the tree is well-formed (fmt, clippy, the
# 300-line cap, the ast-grep rules, cargo-deny, coverage); nothing asked
# whether it discloses something. yog exists to drive real agent sessions on a
# real box, so the material it could leak is exactly the material it handles:
# brazen credentials, Claude Code session transcripts, world paths under an
# operator's home, opslog dumps.
#
# The rules live next door in `scripts/leak-rules.sh`; this file is mechanism.
#
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh              scan the whole tracked tree (the gate)
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh FILE...      scan exactly these files (commit-msg)
#   scripts/leak-scan.sh --self-test  prove every rule still fires, and that
#                                     none fires on the clean fixture
#
# THE TREE IT SCANS IS THE ONE IT IS RUN IN, WHICH NEED NOT BE THIS REPO
# (bl-1043). The rule table is resolved from the SCRIPT's own directory and the
# tree from `git rev-parse` in the working directory, so the same mechanism and
# the same table judge yog's index and the balls TASK STORE — a different git
# repo entirely (`<state>/balls/clones/<enc>/tasks`, holding `tasks/*.md`),
# written by `bl`, never reached by this repo's pre-commit hook. Ball bodies
# are prose on a ref that publishes beside the source, and a second copy of the
# rules for them would drift from this one inside a week. Its callers are
# `scripts/yog-leak-gate` (the balls plugin, before the store is pushed) and
# `.github/workflows/store-scan.yml` (the published ref, after).
#
# THE TREE MODE READS INDEX BLOBS, NOT THE WORKTREE. That is the whole of
# bl-167d's headline: this scan used to enumerate `git ls-files` and then hand
# those PATH NAMES to grep, which opens the WORKTREE file — so a leak that was
# `git add`ed and then overwritten with a clean copy on disk was committed
# without the gate ever reading the bytes it was gating. `git checkout-index`
# materializes the index into a scratch directory and the scan reads that, so
# the bytes scanned are the bytes committed. The index rather than the diff,
# for the same reason `make line-cap` reads it: a diff-only gate is a sampling,
# not an invariant, and a file that leaked once and was never touched again
# would never be looked at again.
#
# THE REGRESSION HALF IS `--self-test`, and its harness lives next door in
# `scripts/leak-selftest.sh` — sourced into this shell, never re-implementing
# the mechanism, and in its own file because "mechanism" and "the proof the
# mechanism still bites" are a real seam rather than a shaved line. Its head
# carries the reasoning; the one rule of it that binds THIS file is the next
# paragraph.
#
# A `grep -q` HERE READS FROM A HERESTRING, NEVER FROM A PIPE, and the check at
# the foot of `self_test` (leak-selftest.sh) holds every tracked bash script in
# the tree to it. A `grep -q` on the receiving end of a pipe is a race, not a
# style: it exits the instant it matches and closes the read end, the writer is
# killed by SIGPIPE part-way through its own write, and `set -o pipefail` then
# takes the pipeline's status from that DEAD WRITER rather than from the reader
# that answered — so the pipeline reports FAILURE exactly when the pattern
# MATCHED. `PIPESTATUS` at a false answer reads `141 0`. In `scan_paths`, where
# the shape is `&& report`, it DROPS a real forbidden path in silence, which is
# the gate lying rather than a harness mis-scoring itself. The ban is on the
# SHAPE rather than on the option, because a sourced file cannot see whether
# its caller set `pipefail`. Measured and reasoned in full on yog bl-e33a.
#
# NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THE TREE SCAN ANY MORE. The scanner and its rule
# table used to be skipped for being made of the patterns; they are scanned,
# and stay clean because no pattern may match its own text (leak-rules.sh
# says how). A rule fixture is scanned by every rule EXCEPT the one it is the
# fixture of — its own rule must flag it, that is its contract — which is a
# structural exemption keyed to the file's own name, not an allowlist: adding
# a file to it means adding a RULE of that name.
#
# WHAT A COMMIT HOOK CANNOT PROMISE. This scans ONE TREE. Old commits, other
# refs, pull-request and release text, Actions logs, build artifacts and
# already-published crate versions are all outside it, and no hook can reach
# them; a gate that implied otherwise would be worse than one that says so.
# They are a RELEASE CHECKLIST instead — AGENTS.md, "Before making the repo or
# a crate version public".
#
# Known limits, stated rather than implied:
#   - IPv6 is matched in full 8-group form only. The compressed `::` forms
#     cannot be told from Rust path syntax (`deadbeef::cafe`) without a false
#     positive rate that would get the whole gate disabled.
#   - A four-part version string (major.minor.patch.build) is
#     indistinguishable from an IPv4 address. If one ever lands, it goes in
#     the rule's EXCEPT list.
#   - Ordinary prose is not detectable. A pasted paragraph of somebody's
#     conversation with no speaker label and no session key reads as writing;
#     `quoted-dialogue` catches the SHAPE transcripts arrive in, which is all
#     a regex can do.

# The table travels with the SCANNER, not with the tree under scan: run in the
# task store there is no `scripts/` to source, and a copy of the rules there
# would be a second definition of what counts as a leak. Resolved BEFORE the

# `--self-test` and the fixture skip stay tree-relative, because the fixtures
# are tracked files of THIS repo and only this repo's scan has any to skip.
